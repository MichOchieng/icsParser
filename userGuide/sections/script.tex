\section*{Running the script}
After generating a parse file from the executable:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open up adobe illustrator
    \item Hover over the file tab and navigate down to \textbf{\textit{scripts}}
    \item Select the \textbf{\textit{Other Script}} option
\end{itemize}
\\

\end{center}
\\
From here select the \textbf{\textit{adobe.jsx}} file in the program folder. Make sure that there is also a file named \textbf{\textit{parsefile.txt}} as well as the \textbf{\textit{timeTable.ai}} file in the same directory as the adobe.jsx script, otherwise the schedule will not be generated.
